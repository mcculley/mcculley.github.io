  <p>This is my current list of supplements that I am taking daily, with associated research and rationale. I am documenting this to make it easier to track and purchase refills and to help others and get their input. My particular needs and interests around supplementation are specific to my sex (male), age (49), body mass (5&apos;11&quot; currently at 180 pounds), and occupation (mostly sedentary and indoors with daily exercise). This approach might be useful for others in the same demographic and not necessarily others.</p>

  <p>
My research is far from exhaustive and I have no formal education in nutrition or biology.
I am interested in input from others on studies that may change how I approach supplementation, either increasing/reducing/eliminating current supplements or adding others.
Where supplements may have no good evidence for being beneficial but are low risk/cost, I am willing to take them even lacking good evidence in their favor.
</p>

<p>
My approach to supplementation has been to just take more over time as I found information that indicated a credible benefit. There may be duplication in what I am taking in terms of benefit. (Does taking vitamin E mean I should not take zinc? I don&apos;t know.) Maybe I am getting what I need for some elements out of my diet. I don&apos;t know. I am interested in feedback on this from those that are curious or better informed. Please send such feedback to <a href="mailto:mcculley@enki.org">mcculley@enki.org</a>.

  <h2 id="vitaminD">Vitamin D</h2>
  <p>
<abbr title="U.S. National Institutes of Health"><a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov">NIH</a><abbr> <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/">recommends</a> 600 <abbr title="International Unit">IU</abbr>/15 <abbr title="microgram">mcg</abbr> daily.
At least one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21154195/">study finds that vitamin D supplementation might increase testosterone levels</a>.
There is a lot of debate about how much vitamin D supplementation one should get. Many modern people are not outside enough to get enough from sunlight.
Ideally, one would use a blood test to determine how much supplementation is necessary. It is possible that I am taking too much.
</p>

  <h2 id="vitaminE">Vitamin E</h2>
  <p>
<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/">Vitamin E is involved in immune function</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="vitaminK">Vitamin K</h2>
  <p>
The <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/">benefits of vitamin K</a> are not at all clear to me. There are particular kinds of vitam K and I have no idea if the combination I am taking does any good. I originally started taking it because I read that it can help with tooth tarter for some people. My dental hygienist says my tooth tarter buildup has decreased, so I am taking it for now, but this could be for no real measurable gain.
  </p>

  <h2 id="echinacea">Echinacea</h2>
  <p>
    There is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24868871/">evidence that echninacea has immunostimulatory effects</a>.
    In my own anecdotal experience, I suffered no colds for many years while supplementing with echinacea and caught a cold or sinus infection after going a couple months without supplements.
    This falls under the category of low risk and cost for possible benefit.
  </p>

  <h2 id="lecithin">Lecithin</h2>
  <p>
    Lecithin is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015313001116">documented to reduce cholesterol levels</a>, which is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.
  </p>

  <h2 id="zinc">Zinc</h2>
  <p>
Zinc is <a href="">recommended for immune function</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010824/">sexual health</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="fishoil">Fish Oil</h2>
  <p>
Fish oil is <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/">documented to have benefits to cardiovascular health and cancer risk</a>, among other benefits. It seems that the jury is out on which kinds of fish oil are best. I have no idea if I am taking the right kind(s).
  </p>

  <h2 id="garlic">Garlic</h2>
  <p>
   There have been a lot of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/">studies</a> done on the benefit of garlic for inflammation and immune response, among other benefits.
  </p>

  <h2 id="coq10">Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub></h2>
  <p>
The <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/coenzyme-q10">benefits of Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> are not clear at all</a>. It is thought to contribute to heart health.
  </p>

  <h2 id="magnesium">Magnesium</h2>
  <p>
Magnesium supplementation has lots of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits#TOC_TITLE_HDR_10">documented benefits</a> for sleep, exercise performance, and diabetes.
