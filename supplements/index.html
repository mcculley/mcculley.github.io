  <p>
This is a list of supplements that I am currently taking daily, with associated research and rationale.
Where possible, I include links to studies that prove a benefit.
I am interested in an evidence-based approach to supplementation.
I am not even convinced that supplements are even a good idea overall.
One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718345601">study claims that they are largely ineffective</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am documenting this to make it easier to track and purchase refills and to help others and get their input.
My particular needs and interests around supplementation are specific to my sex (male), age (49), body mass (5&apos;11&quot; currently at 180 pounds), and occupation (mostly sedentary and indoors with daily exercise).
My particular goals are to prolong healthspan and maximize energy.
This approach might be useful for others in the same demographic and not necessarily others.
</p>

  <p>
My research is far from exhaustive and I have no formal education in nutrition or biology.
I am interested in input from others on studies that may change how I approach supplementation, either increasing/reducing/eliminating current supplements or adding other kinds.
Where supplements may have no good evidence for being beneficial but are low risk/cost, I am willing to take them even lacking good evidence in their favor.
</p>

<p>
My approach to supplementation has been to add more kinds over time as I encountered information that indicated a credible benefit.
There may be duplication in what I am taking in terms of benefit.
(Does taking vitamin E mean I should not take zinc? I don&apos;t know.) Maybe I am getting what I need for some elements out of my diet.
I don&apos;t know.
I am interested in feedback on this from those that are curious or better informed.
Please send such feedback to <a href="mailto:mcculley@enki.org">mcculley@enki.org</a>.

  <h2 id="calcium">Calcium</h2>
  <p>
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/calcium-supplements/art-20047097">Calcium supplementation is recommended for bone health, especially in older people</a>. There is a danger of taking too much calcium or the wrong kind, leading to kidney stones. As I have a history of kidney stones, I am tinkering with adjusting this. I have been supplementing with calcium for years now with no increased incidence of kidney stones, though I am very diligent about hydration.
  </p>

  <h2 id="creatineHCl">Creatine HCl</h2>
  <p>
Creatine has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407788/">shown to boost energy and play a role in muscle protein synthesis</a>. It is not clear to me if I am taking the best amount for me. I am cautious about creating kidney stone problems.
  </p>

  <h2 id="vitaminB12">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></h2>
  <p>
Many people say that vitamin B<sub>12</sub> helps with energy. I have found no clear evidence that this is the case or that one does not get what one needs from food. For right now, this is low cost/risk for me and I need all the energy I can get.
  </p>

  <h2 id="vitaminD">Vitamin D</h2>
  <p>
<abbr title="U.S. National Institutes of Health"><a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov">NIH</a><abbr> <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/">recommends</a> 600 <abbr title="International Unit">IU</abbr>/15 <abbr title="microgram">mcg</abbr> daily.
At least one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21154195/">study finds that vitamin D supplementation might increase testosterone levels</a>.
There is a lot of debate about how much vitamin D supplementation one should get. Many modern people are not outside enough to get enough from sunlight.
Ideally, one would use a blood test to determine how much supplementation is necessary. It is possible that I am taking too much.
</p>

  <h2 id="vitaminE">Vitamin E</h2>
  <p>
<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/">Vitamin E is involved in immune function</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="vitaminK">Vitamin K</h2>
  <p>
The <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/">benefits of vitamin K</a> are not at all clear to me. There are particular kinds of vitamin K and I have no idea if the combination I am taking does any good. I originally started taking it because I read that it can help with tooth tarter for some people. My dental hygienist says my tooth tarter buildup has decreased, so I am taking it for now, but this could be for no real measurable gain.
  </p>

  <h2 id="echinacea">Echinacea</h2>
  <p>
    There is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24868871/">evidence that echninacea has immunostimulatory effects</a>.
    In my own anecdotal experience, I suffered no colds for many years while supplementing with echinacea and caught a cold or sinus infection after going a couple months without supplements.
    This falls under the category of low risk and cost for possible benefit.
  </p>

  <h2 id="lecithin">Lecithin</h2>
  <p>
    Lecithin is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015313001116">documented to reduce cholesterol levels</a>, which is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.
  </p>

  <h2 id="zinc">Zinc</h2>
  <p>
Zinc is <a href="">recommended for immune function</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010824/">sexual health</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="fishoil">Fish Oil</h2>
  <p>
Fish oil is <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/">documented to have benefits to cardiovascular health and cancer risk</a>, among other benefits. It seems that the jury is out on which kinds of fish oil are best. I have no idea if I am taking the right kind(s).
  </p>

  <h2 id="garlic">Garlic</h2>
  <p>
   There have been a lot of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/">studies</a> done on the benefit of garlic for inflammation and immune response, among other benefits.
  </p>

  <h2 id="coq10">Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub></h2>
  <p>
The <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/coenzyme-q10">benefits of Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> are not clear at all</a>. It is thought to contribute to heart health.
  </p>

  <h2 id="pumpSurge">Pump Surge Caffeine Free Pump & Nootropic Pre Workout Supplement</h2>
  <p>
<a href="https://enki.org/2017/08/13/quitting-caffeine/">I quit caffeine</a> a few years ago. I currently take a caffeine free pre-workout in the morning. This definitely helps with my energy level as I generally skip breakfast and lunch. These pre-workout powders seem to be all about proprietary compounds, woo, and bro science. I am interest in replacing with something simpler.
  </p>

  <h2 id="magnesium">Magnesium</h2>
  <p>
Magnesium supplementation has lots of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits#TOC_TITLE_HDR_10">documented benefits</a> for sleep, exercise performance, and diabetes.
