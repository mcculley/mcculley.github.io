  <p>This is my current list of supplements that I am taking daily, with associated research and rationale. I am documenting this to make it easier to track and purchase refills and to help others and get their input. My particular needs and interests around supplementation are specific to my sex (male), age (49), and occupation (mostly sedentary and indoors with daily exercise). This approach should be applicable for others in the same demographic and not necessarily others.</p>

  <p>
My research is far from exhaustive and I have no formal education in nutrition or biology.
I am interested in input from others on studies that may change how I approach supplementation, either increasing/reducing/eliminating current supplements or adding others.
Some of these supplements may have no good evidence for being beneficial but are low risk/cost, so I am willing to take them even lacking good evidence in their favor.

  <h2 id="vitaminD">Vitamin D</h2>
  <p>
<abbr title="U.S. National Institutes of Health"><a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov">NIH</a><abbr> <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/">recommends</a> 600 <abbr title="International Unit">IU</abbr>/15 <abbr title="microgram">mcg</abbr> daily.
At least one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21154195/">study finds that vitamin D supplementation might increase testosterone levels</a>.
There is a lot of debate about how much vitamin D supplementation one should get. Many modern people are not outside enough to get enough from sunlight.
Ideally, one would use a blood test to determine how much supplementation is necessary. It is possible that I am taking too much.

  <h2 id="echinacea">Echinacea</h2>
  <p>
    There is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24868871/">evidence that echninacea has immunostimulatory effects</a>.
    In my own anecdotal experience, I suffered no colds for many years while supplementing with echinacea and caught a cold or sinus infection after going a couple months without supplements.
    This falls under the category of low risk and cost for possible benefit.

  <h2 id="lecithin">Lecithin</h2>
  <p>
    Lecithin is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015313001116">documented to reduce cholesterol levels</a>, which is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.
