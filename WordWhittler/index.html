    <p>
      WordWhittler is a writing assistant.
      It leverages <a href="https://languagetool.org">LanguageTool</a> and <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a> (via <a href="https://extjwnl.sourceforge.net">extJWNL</a>) to provide you with hints and suggestions on how to improve your writing.
      When composing text, the word under your cursor is looked up, providing synomymns and other related words at a glance.
